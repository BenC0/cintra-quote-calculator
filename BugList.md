# Bugs

## Calculation Bugs
### High Priority
1. Capture Expense Pricing - One Time Fee, value equals 12% of Estimated Monthly Charges, can be toggled on/off.
2. Capture Expense doesn't round to lowest minimum qty banding, instead it uses exact qty value.
### Low Priority
1. Quote seems to return slightly different figures when selecting weekly payroll options. I suspect this is related to decimal places / floating point precision.

## PSQ Bugs
### High Priority
1. Sector - Needs integrating
2. PSQ HR Outsourcing - Fixed Price, needs integrating
### Low Priority
1. PSQ - Cintra Cloud Training - Provided spreadsheet has fixed values, needs integrating

## User Interface Bugs
### High Priority
### Low Priority
1. Custom Products aren't tested/used/accounted for. 
1. Clone occasionaly breaks.
2. Editing pre-existing plan has no Staging, it's live editing.
3. Preselecting default values for dropdowns not built in.
4. There are a bunch of conditional scenarios, for example, when a user has selected CintraHR, they need to remove Holiday & Absence, and Time Sheets from the Payrolls.
